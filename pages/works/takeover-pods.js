            description="Takeover Pods provides listeners of the Takeover Podcast Network
              an intuitive interface for finding and experiencing content. This
              was a unique challenge as not only does the network provide
              podcast episodes weekly from a variety of content providers, but
              also features a comprehensive blog related to the same topics.
              
              Previously, content providers from TPN posted on various platforms
              including: Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, Spotify, and an
              entire list of streaming providers. Now, upon completion of a
              quick and painless authentication process, creators can post and
              update their content all in one place.

              Inspiration for this application came from some of my favorite
              podcastsâ€™ web applications including: Radiolab, Last Podcast on
              the Left, and the Andrew Huberman Lab. Experience Takeover Pods
              for yourself by visiting the Live Link."
